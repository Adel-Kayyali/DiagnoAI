    ### **About Breast Cancer**\n
    Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the breast cells. It is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases diagnosed in 2020. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment and improved outcomes. Screening methods such as mammography, clinical breast exam, and breast self-exam can help detect breast cancer in its early stages. Treatment options for breast cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormone therapy. However, the type of treatment will depend on several factors such as the stage of cancer, the type of breast cancer, and the patient's overall health.

It can lead to serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and blindness. Proper management of diabetes involves monitoring blood sugar levels, taking medications as prescribed, and making lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy diet and exercising regularly.
