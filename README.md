# **DiagnoAI**
DiagnoAI is a web application that uses machine learning models to perform medical diagnoses. The application currently includes four models for examining breast cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.

### How to Use
DiagnoAI is available on the web and can be accessed through this [link].

To use the application, simply select the type of examination you wish to perform from the sidebar. Depending on the examination selected, you will be prompted to input certain medical measurements related to the disease being examined. Once you have entered all the required information, click the button to receive the diagnosis.

### Dependencies
DiagnoAI was built using **Python 3.8** and the following libraries:

* Streamlit
* Pickle
* Streamlit-Option-Menu
* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas
* Numpy

### Models Used
DiagnoAI uses the following machine learning models to perform medical diagnoses:

**Breast Cancer Examination:** Random Forest Classifier model trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
**Diabetes Examination:** Random Forest Classifier model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
**Heart Examination:** Random Forest Classifier model trained on the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset.
**Parkinsons Examination:** Random Forest Classifier model trained on the Parkinson's Disease Dataset.
